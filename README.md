This map is built for other organizations website.
This map allows organization's donors to see their trees.
The user experience is on the other organization's website.

## Clustering Basics

For performance and UX purposes, since this map needs to deal with an enormous amount of trees, a clustering strategy is used to group those trees, showing information in a way that is more digestible for the end-user.

Although this feature is already implemented, performance optimizations are a work in progress.

### Overriding clustering and map initial zoom for testing

When there is a need to tweak the clusterization behavior, the **cluster radius** and **zoom** can be overrided specifying query strings.
For example, if you need to load the map with an initial zoom level of 15, and a radius of 0.001 you will access it like this:

dev.treetracker.org?**zoom=15&clusterRadius=0.001**

When these values are overriden, you can zoom and drag the map freely, while keeping the same clusterization behaviors.

Another useful tool to use in conjunction with this is the web browser's console (in Chrome or Firefox, hit F12 to open it). Whenever the map is updated, current zoom level and cluster radius used will be output to the console, so you have a better idea of what is going on.

Future: 
* Filters and Statistics
* View photo together with tree data
* View planter profile.
